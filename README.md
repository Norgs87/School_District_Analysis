# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
### The analysis for this delevirable focused on using Jupyter Notebook and the power of PythonData to analyze school testing data.  After we ran the data with results of the scores grouped into different areas, we then replaced the scores of one school Thomas High School 9th Grade Scores with NaN since they were suspected of cheating
## Results
### The results were defenentitely changed by removing the Thomas High School's 9th grade reading and math scores.  One of the first things that I noticed was how Thomas High Schools scores dropped the scores of the district schools.  The first image is original what the stats looked like and the second is refactoring the code.

### Another thing that noticed was when you looked the scores by grade for eeach school it is pretty easy to pick up where Thomas High School is

By Changing the scores, the results also 

The last thing that I noticed when looking over the differences between the two files was how it changed the scores for spending amount, with the first image from the original code and the second from the refactored.

## Challenges
### The biggest challenge that I had was trying to try and refactor the code so Thomas High Schools 10-12 grades weren't affected by the 9th grade scores, I couldn't quite get it to work so my data shows Thomas High School with the 9th grade dragging the rest of the school down.
